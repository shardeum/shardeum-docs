## What is Shardeum?

Shardeum is an EVM-based sharded layer 1 blockchain that uses dynamic state sharding to increase transactions per second (TPS) with the addition of every new node. This will allow the network to have very low and constant transaction fees forever asides from infinite scalability.

## Which languages are used for smart contracts on Shardeum?

EVM-based languages is used to compile smart contracts; this includes Solidity and Vyper.

## How can I contribute to Shardeum Sphinx as a developer?

You can build and deploy smart contracts on Sphinx by following this developer documentation. Further, list your dApps you are building on Sphinx [here](https://forms.gle/BFLXtLn9Urq9KH998) to publicize it among the community and become a leader in the Shardeum ecosystem.

Pro-tip: If you already have a smart contract deployed on Ethereum, you can migrate it to Sphinx within a few minutes.

## What can the community do on Sphinx?

Everyone in the Shardeum community can add Sphinx network to their wallet, request testnet SHM from the faucet, and interact with the [smart contracts built on it](https://shardeum.org/ecosystem/). 

## I already have a smart contract deployed on Ethereum. Can I easily migrate it to Shardeum?

Since Shardeum is EVM-based, it's as simple as deploying your existing code to the Shardeum network. If you have built for Ethereum, you have built for Shardeum!

## What rewards can I expect if I build dApps on Shardeum Sphinx?

There will be an ecosystem fund setup to reward devs for creating innovative apps on Shardeum. You would be able to apply for a grant. More information will be posted on the Shardeum.org site about the process to apply.

## I found some bugs on Shardeum Explorer. How do we report it?

Please use this form to report bugs when you face any issues on Sphinx so our developers can look into it for improvement opportunities : https://github.com/Shardeum/shardeum-bug-reporting

## What is the use of the faucet and testnet $SHM coins on Sphinx?

SHM is the network coin like ETH for Ethereum. SHM is used to pay the gas fees when
you transact on the network for developing dApps and transferring tokens. You simply have to add Sphinx network to your wallets like MetaMask and receive 100 testnet $SHM by following the [instructions](https://docs.shardeum.org/faucet/claim). As mentioned before developers may qualify for grants while community members will stand a chance to qualify for rewards/airdrops from dApp projects in the future for helping them to stress test their projects. In order to take part in testing out such dApps, $SHM can be very useful to pay transaction fees to carry out a transaction.

## How to find which projects are building on Sphinx so I can consider interacting with their interfaces and stand a chance to earn rewards in the future?

Community and developers can easily find the list of projects that are building on Sphinx [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kthKCY097MlNwfm8g8OAhldmFOE5rTG9vwl7FHrnDEk/edit#gid=907836377).

## How can I promote the project I am building on Shardeum to its community and other developers?

We encourage you to fill up and submit this simple [form](https://forms.gle/BFLXtLn9Urq9KH998) which will be transposed into a spreadsheet in raw form for easy consumption by the Shardeum community and other devs building on the network. This spreadsheet is stored on the project’s google drive which is open to the public.

## RPC is slow. Is there any ongoing issue?

Shardeum Public RPC has a pretty high limit of throughput and a high rate limiting criteria. If you are having RPC issues, please try again in a while. We will soon introduce multiple other public RPCs for redundancy purposes.
