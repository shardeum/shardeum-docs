description: Steps to run a Shardeum Local Data RPC
---

### What is a LD-RPC?
LD-RPC (Local Data RPC) is a general RPC capable of storing data locally and serving it from there. The regular RPC server used to initially query a lot of components for information. It used to query Archiver and explorer services to get the data for each request, increasing the load on the network and leading to slower response times.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
LD-RPCs are primarily expected to be run by seasoned Infrastructure providers who want to provide RPC services on Shardeum. General public is not expected to run RPCs and running a RPC has no direct rewards unlike a Validator.
</Callout>


With LD-RPC, the Archiver gets info from the validators and serves that to a distributor. A collector subscribes to the distributor and is set up as a server to be used by the RPC server. These streaming services help the RPC server to have the data locally, eliminating the need for constant calls to the Shardeum's explorer, archiver, or validator services.

## Components of LD-RPC

**[Distributor Service](https://github.com/shardeum/relayer-distributor)**: The Archivers run a Distributor server that makes the collected data available to subscribers. The Distributor service provides APIs to allow Collectors to subscribe and establishes a socket connection with the collector to stream the data.

**[Collector Service](https://github.com/shardeum/relayer-collector.git)**: Collector service subscribes to Distributors and collects data from them in real-time, stores this data in a local SQLite3 DB, and provides API endpoints to serve this data to further downstream services.

**[Service Validator](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum.git)**: A special type of Shardeum validator which does not join the network or make network calls to the active components in a running network like the active validators or the archivers and always relies on the local account DB for all its data needs.

## System Requirements
Here are the recommended system requirements for running a LD-RPC:

- 16 cores CPU
- 32 GB RAM
- 500 GB SSD (Expected to grow overtime)
- Linux-based OS 


## Install dependencies

- Build essentials

```bash
apt-get update
apt install build-essential
```

- NVM

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc 
```

- Node

Install and set Node 18.16.1 (Other versions may bot be compatible)

```bash
nvm install 18.16.1
nvm use 18.16.1
nvm alias default 18.16.1
```

- Node gyp & Python

```bash
npm i -g node-gyp
npm config set python `which python3`
npm config list
```

If you don’t have python3 installed, please follow [docs](https://docs.python.org/3.12/using/unix.html) and install it.

```bash
which python3
npm config edit

# set the python path
python=<your/path/to/python3>
```
Then confirm your python setting

```bash
npm config get python
/usr/bin/python3  # or similar
```

- Install pm2

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

- Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain 1.74.1
source ~/.bashrc
```

Rust version and Cargo version should match below:

```bash
rustc --version
rustc 1.74.1 (a28077b28 2023-12-04)

cargo --version
cargo 1.74.1 (cfd3bbd8f 2023-06-08)
```
That's it! All the dependencies are now installed. Let's setup the inidividual services now.


## Collector setup

- Clone the collector codebase using below command:

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/shardeum/relayer-collector.git collector
cd collector
npm install
```

- Update the **config.json** file with correct **distributorInfo** and **collectorInfo**:

<Callout title="Whitelisting keys" type="error">
    You can request distributor and collector info from the Shardeum team or else you can generate a key-pair of your own and request the administrator to whitelist your keys on the one of the running distributors. (For steps on how to create a key-pair for collector server refer to the steps mentioned at the bottom of this document). In future, you will be able to setup your own distributor.
</Callout>

```bash
"distributorInfo": {
	"ip": "<distributor-server-ip>",        //eg: 127.0.0.1
	"port": "<distributor-server-port>", //eg: 6100
	"publicKey": "distributor-server-public-key"
},

"collectorInfo": {
	 "publicKey": "<collector-pub-key>",
	"secretKey": "<collector-secret-key>"
 }
```

- Update [src/config/index.ts](https://github.com/shardeum/relayer-collector/blob/dev/src/config/index.ts)

Update the following parameters in the index.ts file

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
Value of `shardeumIndexerSqlitePath` depends on where you set up the service validator. Please check below how to set one up and accordingly update the value here.
</Callout>
```bash
enableShardeumIndexer: true,
blockIndexing.enabled: true,
enableCollectorSocketServer: true,
shardeumIndexerSqlitePath: '<Path-To-Service-Validator-Code>/db/shardeum.sqlite'  //eg: /home/user/code/service-validator/db/shardeum.sqlite
```

We will start the collectorservice after setting up Service validator in the next step.

## Service Validator setup

- Clone the service-validator codebase using below command:

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum.git service-validator
cd service-validator
npm install
mkdir db
```

- Update **config.json** file
```bash
- server.ip.externalPort: 7001
- server.ip.internalPort: 11001,
// You can change the port values if you would like to run the service-validator on any other port.
- Add archiver info to server.p2p.existingArchivers
It should be a list of archivers:
eg:
[
        {
          "ip": "<archiver-ip>",
          "port":<archiver-port>,
          "publicKey": "<archiver-pub-key>"
        }
]
```

- Update [src/shardeum/shardeumFlags.ts](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/blob/dev/src/shardeum/shardeumFlags.ts)

```bash
- startInServiceMode: true
```

## Start all the services

- Start Collector services

Change directory to Collector & compile the code
```bash
cd ../collector
npm run prepare 
```

- Start the main data collector
```bash
cd ../collector
pm2 start --name collector-data-server --node-args="--max_old_space_size=16000" npm -- run collector
```

- Start the collector API server
```bash
pm2 start --name collector-api-server01  npm -- run server 6001
```
- Start the collector LOG server
```bash
pm2 start --name collector-log-server01  npm -- run log_server 4446
```

You can use the following endpoint to check the status of data. Be sure that some data quantity is shown instead of all 0.

```bash
curl `http://<collector-ip>:<collector-port>/totalData`
# eg: when running on a local network http://127.0.0.1:6001/totalData
```
- Check status of services
```bash
pm2 list
```

- Check logs to confirm collector has successfully started
```bash
pm2 logs -f <pm2-process-id>
# pm2 id of collector log
```


- Start the service-validator service using below command:
```bash
cd ../service-validator
npm run prepare
pm2 start dist/src/index.js --name service-validator
```

- Check if service validator has started
```bash
pm2 list
```

## Start the JSON-RPC setup

- Clone the json-rpc codebase using below command:

```bash
cd ..
git clone -b dev https://github.com/shardeum/json-rpc-server.git json-rpc-server 
cd json-rpc-server
npm install
```

- Update src/config.ts file

```bash
- collectorSourcing.enabled: true
- collectorSourcing.collectorApiServerUrl: 'http://<collector-server-ip>:<collector-server-port>' // eg: for local-network set this to http://127.0.0.1:6001, if you had used different port while setting up collector server, please use that one
- serviceValidatorSourcing.enabled: true
- serviceValidatorSourcing.serviceValidatorUrl: 'http://<service-validator-ip>:<service-validator-port>' // eg: for local-network set this to http://127.0.0.1:7001, if you had used different port while setting up service validator, please use that one
- websocket.enabled: true
- queryFromValidator: false
```

- Update archiverConfig.json with correct Archiver info

Update archiverConfig.json
```bash
{
  "archivers": [
    {
      "ip": "<archiver-ip>",
      "port":<archiver-port>,
      "publicKey": "<archiver-pub-key>"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Start the json-rpc service using below command
```bash
npm run compile
node pm2.js <X> 
# for X RPC servers, starting port 8080
```
Check status of json-rpc services
```bash
Use command: pm2 list
```

## How to validate if RPC server is working?
Once your RPC server is running, you can test it by making some read calls. 

By default RPC is set at port 8080. So your RPC will be something like 
```bash
http://<json_rpc-server-ip>:<json-rpc-server-port>
```
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' http://<json_rpc-server-ip>:<json-rpc-server-port>
```
<Callout title="Note" type="info">
It is advised that you give the node at least 10 minutes to sync after spinning it up to avoid issues.
