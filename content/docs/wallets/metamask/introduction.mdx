Available as a browser extension and as a mobile app, MetaMask equips you with a key vault, secure login, token wallet, and token exchange—everything you need to manage your digital assets.

MetaMask provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. You are always in control when interacting on the new decentralized web.

MetaMask generates passwords and keys on your device, so only you have access to your accounts and data. You always choose what to share and what to keep private.
